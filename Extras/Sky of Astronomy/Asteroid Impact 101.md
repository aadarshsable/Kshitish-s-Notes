While reading about the very recent fly-by of 2015 RN35* which has been dubbed as the "Christmas Asteroid" by European Space Agency (ESA); I saw reassurances from astronomers about the asteroid not hitting  us. This led me down the rabbit hole of the Torino Scale and its more quantitative cousin the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale; and how they are used to describe destruction and our possible demise.**

## Torino Scale

Torino scale serves a communication tool between Astronomers and the general public. It wraps up probability of an object hitting the earth and the estimated kinetic energy with which it can hit the earth into a single threat value that ranges from 0 to 10.

The Torino scale can also be divided into 5 categories.
1. No Hazard (0)
2. Normal (1)
3. Requires Attention (from astronomers) (2-4)
4. Threatening (5-7)
5. Disaster level (8-10)

Most objects get assigned some n>0 value when discovered first but after some more observation and calculations. They can get reassigned back to 0.
Public officials need to only worry about smaller Torino scale objects if they are confirmed to be in same decade.

Most small meteors that enter the earth's atmosphere get burned up and hence are placed in scale 0. Scale 0 also includes objects that do not come close enough to earth.
The Chicxulub impact, that most scientists believe to be the cause of extinction for non-avian dinosaurs has been rated at scale 10.
The Barringer Crater and Tunguska event have been rated at 8.

Scale 10 events are capable of destroying all flora and fauna and can sometimes have an approach kinetic energy in orders of 10^8 megatons. 1 megatons = 4.18 x 10^12 kJ which is enough energy for an active teenager to survive 1.6 x 10^11 years which is greater than the current age of universe (~1.38 x 10^10 years).

Fortunately for us no incoming object has been rated above 4 on the Torino scale. So the chances of mass destruction or outright extinction due to asteroid impact in the upcoming century is negligible.

## Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale

Unlike Torino scale that lies more on the qualitative side of scaling owing to the ranking it does, Palermo scale is a more quantitative scale. It too combines the probability of the impact and the estimated kinetic yield into a single number but the number is left  as it is and not grouped into any such category.

Because of its quantitative nature and for convenience, Palermo scale is a logarithmic scale. A rating of 0 on this scale means that the danger is equivalent to a background hazard which essentially is defined as the average risk possessed by objects on same size or larger over the years until the date of potential impact. By estimating the background hazard level of Earth impacts, we define a value for the threat from the entire asteroid averaged over very long periods of time. Because there are vastly more small asteroids than there are large ones in space, the rate of background impact depends upon the size of the NEO.

If the hazard is represented by n, then the hazard is 10^n times more dangerous than the background hazard. Values of n lesser than -2 are considered to be events without any likely consequences.

As of December 2022, only two objects have Palermo values of greater than -3, one of them with -1.59 and the other with -2.05**.

Much of the utility of Palermo scale lies in the fact that it can be used to assess values less threatening then Torino scale 0, which makes up almost all of the impacts we have detected till date. 

## Sentry and cneos

cneos is short for Center for Near Earth Object Studies which is a component of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) NASA which as the name suggests is one of the few places where near earth objects are monitored and studied.

Sentry is automated collision monitoring system developed by cneos that continuously scans the most current asteroid catalogues for possible impacts over the next 100 years. Whenever a potential impact is detected it is analyzed and the results are published onto the list. Objects are also removed from the list whenever there are no more potential impact detections.***

**: The title is somewhat misleading as the methods described below work for all NEOs (Near Earth Objects) which include both asteroids and comets.
