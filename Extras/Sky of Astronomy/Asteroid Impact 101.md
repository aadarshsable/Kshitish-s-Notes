The tittle is incorrect, the methods described below work for all NEOs (Near Earth Objects). While reading about the very recent "fly-by" of 2015 RN35 which has been dubbed as the "Christmas Asteroid" for the masses, I stumbled upon the Torino Scale and its more quantitative cousin the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale. So lets start with the qualitative one first.

## Torino Scale

Torino scale serves a communication tool between Astronomers and the general public. It wraps up probability of an object hitting the earth and the speed* at which it can hit the earth into a single threat value that ranges from 0 to 10.

The Torino scale can also be divided into 5 categories.
1. No Hazard (0)
2. Normal (1)
3. Requires Attention (from astronomers) (2-4)
4. Threatening (5-7)
5. Disaster level (8-10)

So lets try to go through what each of them mean:

0. The possibility of collision is 0 or negligible enough to be treated as 0. This category also includes smaller objects that will burn in our atmosphere before being capable of doing any harm.

1. A close pass near the Earth that possesses no unusual level of danger. Mostly from periodic objects. It gets shifted down to 0, upon more data collection.

2. Another close pass near earth. No public concerns but astronomers have to determine if its periodic. Gets downgraded to 0 upon more telescopic observations.

3. A close counter which needs attention from astronomers. These objects have a 1% or greater chance of causing localized destructions. Attention from the public is needed only when the encounter is less than a decade away.

4. Same as scale 3 but instead of small scale destruction, the area of impact is a little bigger.

5. A close encounter posing a serious but still uncertain threat of regional devastation.  Urgent attention by astronomers is required to find the time and place of collisions. If the encounter is less than a decade away, public action is needed.

6. Same as scale 5 but the size of the object is much bigger which can cause global catastrophe. Public action is needed if encounter is less than 3 decades away.

7. Same as scale 6 but the object is bigger and it has an even closer encounter with earth. There is a chance of global catastrophe, which needs international cooperation. This  scale calls for public action for any such event happening within the century.

8. A collision that is capable of causing certain localized destruction or even tsunamis if impact location is in some ocean.

9. Same as scale 8 but more destructive and rarer. They occur on average every 10k or 100k years.

10. A collision that can cause annihilation and can destroy flora and fauna. They occur on average every 100k years or less.

The Chicxulub impact that most scientists believe to be the cause of extinction for non-avian dinosaurs has been rated at scale 10.
The Barringer Crater and Tunguska event have been rated at 8.

Fortunately for us
