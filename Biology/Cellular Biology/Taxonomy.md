**Taxonomy** is the branch of biology that names and classifies species into groups of increasing breadths.

## Importance of Taxonomy

- Approximately 1.8 million species have been identified and named to date, and thousand more are identified each year. Grouping them into categories allows scientists some reductional approach into understanding each species.
- Having a unique name is important for exchange of information between people from various regions around the globe.

### Three Domain System

- The *three-domain system* is currently used and it replaces the old **five-kingdom system**.
- **Domain Bacteria** and **Domain Archaea** comprise the prokaryotes.
- **Domain Eukarya** includes all eukaryotic organisms. ![Three Domain System][https://microbiologynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Carl-Woeses-Classification-Three-Domain-Classification-1536x864.jpg]
