Feedback mechanisms allow biological processes to self regulate.
There are two types of feedback mechanism:
- Negative Feedback Mechanism
- Positive Feedback Mechanism

## Negative Feedback Mechanism

*Negative Feedback* means that as more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it **slows** and **less** of the product is produced.
