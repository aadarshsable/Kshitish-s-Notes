Feedback mechanisms allow biological processes to self regulate.
There are two types of feedback mechanism:
- Negative Feedback Mechanism
- Positive Feedback Mechanism

## Negative Feedback Mechanism

*Negative Feedback* means that as more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it **slows** and **less** of the product is produced.

### Examples
- When the stomach content becomes too acidic, the release of *gastrin* is inhibited. Lower levels of gastrin in the blood cause gastric glands to secrete less gastric juice.
- Androgens carried in blood help maintain homeostasis by inhibiting secretion of both FSH and LH.
- The production of red blood cells in the bone marrow is controlled by a negative-feedback mechanism that is sensitive to the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues via the blood.

## Positive Feedback Mechanism

Positive feedback means that as more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it speeds up and more of the product is produced.
