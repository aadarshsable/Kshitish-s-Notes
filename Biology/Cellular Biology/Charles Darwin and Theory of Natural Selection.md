Charles Darwin published [On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species) in 1859.

He made two main points:
- Species showed evidence of "descent with modification" from common ancestors.
- Natural selection is the mechanism behind "descent with modification"

Darwin's theory explained the duality of unity and diversity.
