Charles Darwin published [On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species) in 1859.

He made two main points:
- Species showed evidence of "descent with modification" from common ancestors.
- Natural selection is the mechanism behind "descent with modification"

Darwin's theory explained the duality of unity and diversity.

## Darwin's Observations

- Individuals in a population have traits that vary.
- Many of these traits are heritable.
- More off-springs are produced than survive.
- Competition is inevitable.
- Species generally suit their environment.

### Darwin's Inference
- Individuals are best suited
