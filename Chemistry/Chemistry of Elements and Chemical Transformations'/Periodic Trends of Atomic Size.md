- Atomic size increases down the group because of the addition of more and more shells.
- Atomic size decreases left to right because of the increased attraction due to increase in nuclear charge.
- A cation is always smaller than its parent atom whereas an anion is always bigger than its parent atom. $A^{n+}<A<A^{n-}$

## Exceptions:
1. The atomic radii suddenly increases when going from group 17 to group 18.
	Reason :
	In case of inert gases all orbitals are completely filled and hence the electronic repulsions are maximum.
2. Bismuth (Bi) has a greater radius than Polonium (Po).

## Effective Nuclear Charge

$Z^{*}=Z-\text{ screening constant}(S)$

- It is experienced by the outer most electron only. 
- The value of principal quantum number is very important to calculate the screening constant for any particular electron

### Slater's Rule
1. Write down the electronic configuration of the atom in the following form:
	$(1s)(2s,2p)(3s,3p)(3d)(4s,4p)(4d)(4f)(5s,5p)\dots$

2. Identify the electron of interest, and ignore all electrons in higher groups (to the right of the list from step I).
	They cannot shield electrons in lower groups.

3. Slater's Rule can now be broken in 2 different cases:
	
	1. The shielding experienced by an $s$ or $p$ electron:
		- Electrons within the same group shield *0.35*, except $1s$ which shields *0.30*
		- Electrons within $n-1$ groups shield *0.85*
		- Electrons within $n-2$ or lower groups shield *1.00*
	2. The shielding experienced by an $d$ or $f$ electron:
		- Electrons within the same group shield *0.35*
		- Electrons within lower group shield *1.00*

## Scandide Contraction

The d-block contraction is also known as the Scandide contraction. 

The effect of the d-block contraction occurs on the period of 4 elements due to the full d orbitals. This contraction thing affects the elements *Gallium(Ga)*, *Germanium(Ge)*,*Arsenic(As)*, *Selenium(Se)*, *Bromine(Br)*, and  *Krypton(Kr)* mainly.

## Lanthanide Contraction

- Lanthanide Contraction is the decrease in the size of atoms with increasing atomic number in the lanthanide series.

- It is a steady decrease in the atomic radius and the iconic radius of the chemical elements in the lanthanide series. Further, **this happens because of the filling of $4f$ orbitals with electrons before filling up the $5d$ orbitals.

- Here the $4f$ electrons show a poor shielding towards the nuclear charge, which in turn causes the $6s$ electrons to move towards the nucleus of the atom, resulting in a small radius.

![Lanthanide Contraction](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeroen-De-Decker/publication/317577477/figure/fig5/AS:505013667627008@1497416049414/Ionic-radii-throughout-the-lanthanide-series-demonstrating-lanthanide-contraction.png)

- The shielding effect of $4f$ orbitals is very smaller than $d$ orbitals as $4f$ orbitals are very diffused in nature.
- The elements in which the additional electron enters $(n-2)f$ orbitals are called *inner transition elements*. The valence shell electron configuration of these elements can be represented as $(n-2)f^{0-14}(n-1)d^{0-1}ns^{2}$.
- Any $f$ orbital containing 1 electron is unstable. So, it transfers the electron to $5d$ and due to this the energy of $5d$ decreases and it becomes stable. Now when an electron comes it is then added to $4f$ (cerium).

## Post Lanthanide

1. Occurrence of elements as pairs:
	Due to similar size of $4d$ and $5d$ in a group, they have similar physical and chemical properties. They occur together in nature and their separation becomes very difficult.

2. Densities:
	$5d$ elements have very high densities as down the group there is large increase in mass but almost increase in volume.
