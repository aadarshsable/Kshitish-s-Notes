- Atomic size increases down the group because of the addition of more and more shells.
- Atomic size decreases left to right because of the increased attraction due to increase in nuclear charge.
- A cation is always smaller than its parent atom whereas an anion is always bigger than its parent atom. $A^{n+}<A<A^{n-}$

## Exceptions:
1. The atomic radii suddenly increases when going from group 17 to group 18.
	Reason :
	In case of inert gases all orbitals are completely filled and hence the electronic repulsions are maximum.
2. Bismuth (Bi) has a greater radius than Polonium (Po).

## Effective Nuclear Charge

$Z^{*}=Z-\text{ screening constant}(S)$

- It is experienced by the outer most electron only. 
- The value of principal quantum number is very important to calculate the screening constant for any particular electron

### Slater's Rule
1. Write down the electronic configuration of the atom in the following form:
	$(1s)(2s,2p)(3s,3p)(3d)(4s,4p)(4d)(4f)(5s,5p)\dots$

2. Identify the electron of interest, and ignore all electrons in higher groups (to the right of the list from step I).
	They cannot shield electrons in lower groups.

3. Slater's Rule can now be broken in 2 different cases:
	
	1. The shielding experienced by an $s$ or $p$ electron:
		- Electrons within the same group shield *0.35*, except $1s$ which shields *0.30*
		- Electrons within $n-1$ groups shield *0.85*
		- Electrons within $n-2$ or lower groups shield *1.00*
	2. The shielding experienced by an $d$ or $f$ electron:
		- Electrons within the same group shield *0.35*
		- Electrons within lower group shield *1.00*
