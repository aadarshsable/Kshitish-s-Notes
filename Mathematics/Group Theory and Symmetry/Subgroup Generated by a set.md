Intersection of any two subgroups is itself a subgroup, this is true for *any* collection of subgroups.

Let $G$ be a group. Let $S$ be a set of all subgroups of $G$. Then, the intersection of all subgroups in $S$ is a subgroup of $G$.

### Proof:

Let $K=\cap H \text{ where } H \in S$

#### Identity: 

$1_{G} \in H$ for all $H \in S$, so $1_{G} \in K$

#### Closure under inverses:

Let $x \in K$. So, for any $H \in S$, $x \in H$. As $H$ is a subgroup, $x ^{-1} \in H$. Thus, $x ^{-1}\in H$ for all $H \in S$, $x ^{-1} \in K$

#### Closure under the binary operation:

Let $x,y \in K$. We want to show that $xy \in K$. For any $H \in S$, we have $x,y \in H$. As $H$ is a subgroup, this implies that $xy \in H$. Thus, $xy \in H$ for all $H \in S$. So $xy \in K$.



Thus $K$ is a subgroup.

## Subgroup Generated By a Set

Let $G$ be  a group and let $S$ be a *subset* of $G$. We can define $<S>$ to be the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ which contain $S$. By the previous theorem, $<S>$ is a subgroup of $G$.

If $H$ is any subgroup of $G$ which contains $S$, then $<S> \subseteq H$ because $<S>$ is the intersection of all such subgroups.
Thus, $<S>$ is the **smallest subgroup** containing $S$.

## $<S>$

Let $M$ be the set of all elements of $G$ which can be written in the form $x_{1}^{m_{1}}x_{2}^{m_{2}}\dots x_{r}^{m_{r}}$ where:
- $r$ is a positive integer
- $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\dots x_{r} \in S$ (not necessarily distinct)
- $m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}\dots m_{r} \in \mathbb{Z}$
Also, if $H$ is any subgroup of $G$ containing $S$, $H$ contains every element of the form $x_{1}^{m_{1}}\dots x_{r}^{m_{r}}$ where $x_{1},x_{2},\dots x_{r} \in S$. Thus $M\subseteq H$ for any subgroup $H$.
Thus, $M \subseteq <S>$ (as $<S>$ is the intersection of such subgroups).
However, $M$ is a subgroup containing $S$. So $<S>\subseteq M$. So, $M= <S>$

For example, if $S=\{ a \}$,
$<S>= <a> =\{ 1,a,a ^{-1},a^{2},a^{-2},a^{3},a^{-3},\dots \}$
				=$\{ a^{n} | n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$
If $S= \{ a,b \}$, $<S>$ is the set of elements of all products of the form $a^{m_{1}}b^{n_{1}}a^{m_{2}}b^{n_{2}}\dots a^{m_{r}}b^{n_{r}}$ where $r$ is a positive integer and $m_{i},n_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $i$.
So, a typical element may look like $a^{2}b^{-3}ab^{-2}$.
Note that we may not be able to collect all the $a$ and $b$ together in general. This action is only possible in special abelian groups.
