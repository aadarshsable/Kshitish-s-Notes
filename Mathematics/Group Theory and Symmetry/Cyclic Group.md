Intersection of any two subgroups is itself a subgroup, this is true for *any* collection of subgroups.

Let $G$ be a group. Let $S$ be a set of all subgroups of $G$. Then, the intersection of all subgroups in $S$ is a subgroup of $G$.

### Proof:

Let $K=\cap H \text{ where } H \in S$

#### Identity: 

$1_{G} \in H$ for all $H \in S$, so $1_{G} \in K$

#### Closure under inverses:

Let $x \in K$. So, for any $H \in S$, $x \in H$. As $H$ is a subgroup, $x ^{-1} \in H$. Thus, $x ^{-1}\in H$ for all $H \in S$, $x ^{-1} \in K$

#### Closure under the binary operation:

Let $x,y \in K$. We want to show that $xy \in K$. For any $H \in S$, we have $x,y \in H$. As $H$ is a subgroup, this implies that $xy \in H$. Thus, $xy \in H$ for all $H \in S$. So $xy \in K$.



Thus $K$ is a subgroup.

## Subgroup Generated By a Set

Let $G$ be  a group and let $S$ be a *subset* of $G$. We can define $<S>$ to be the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ which contain $S$. By the previous theorem, $<S>$ is a subgroup of $G$.

If $H$ is any subgroup of $G$ which contains $S$, then $<S> \subseteq H$ because $<S>$ is the intersection of all such subgroups.
Thus, $<S>$ is the smallest subgroup containing $S$.
