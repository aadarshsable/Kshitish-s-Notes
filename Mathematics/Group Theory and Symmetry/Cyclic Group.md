A group $G$ is said to be **cyclic** if there exists an element $a \in G$ such that $G = <a>$.

Examples: $\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic. $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic for any $m>0$.

## Structure of Cyclic Group

Let $G$ be a cyclic group. Suppose $G=<a>$
We have two possibilities:
1. $ord(a)$ is finite
2. $ord(a)$ is infinite

## $ord(a)$ is not finite

This means that there does not exist any positive integer $m$ such that $a^{m}=1$
