The cosets of $m\mathbb{Z}$ are $m\mathbb{Z},1+m\mathbb{Z},\dots$
For integers $a$ and $b$, the following statements are equivalent:
1. $a+m\mathbb{Z}=b+m\mathbb{Z}$
2. $a-b$ is divisible by $m$
3. $a$ and $b$ leave the same remainder when divided by $m$

## Notation

1. If $m$ divides $a-b$, then we can write	$$
	a \equiv b \text{ } mod(m)
	$$This reads as "a is congruent to b modulo m". This essentially means that $a$ and $b$ are in the same coset of $m\mathbb{Z}$.
2. The statement "m divides x" will be symbolically written as $m|x$.

$a \equiv b \text{ } mod(m)$ and
$b \equiv c \text{ } mod(m)$
$\implies a+c \equiv b+d \text{ } mod(m)$
Proof:
$m | a-b \implies a-b \equiv mx$ for some $x \in \mathbb{Z}$
