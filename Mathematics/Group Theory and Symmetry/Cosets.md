Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. If $g$ is any element of $G$, the set:
$gH= \{gh | h \in H \}$ is called a *left coset* of $H$.
Similarly, the set:
$Hg = \{ hg | h \in H \}$ is called a *right coset* of $H$.

Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a subgroup. Then, given two left cosets $g_{1}H$ and $g_{2}H$ of $H$, either $g_{1}H \cap g_{2}H=\phi$ or $g_{1}H=g_{2}H$.

## Notation

The set of all left cosets of $H$ is denoted by $G/H$. Therefore $G / H = \{ H,aH,bH,cH,\dots \}$. Similarly the set
