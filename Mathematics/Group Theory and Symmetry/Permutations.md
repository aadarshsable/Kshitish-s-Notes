Given a set $A$, a permutation of $A$ is a $1-1$ correspondence from $A$ to itself. The set of all permutations of $A$ is denoted by $Perm(A)$

## Properties of Permutation

1. Identity Function:  $id_{A}: A \rightarrow A$ defined by $id_{A}(x) = x$ is an element of $Perm(A)$. For any $f$ in $Perm(A)$: $f \circ id_{A} = id_{A} \circ f = f$
2. If $f,g$ are in $Perm(A)$,the composition $g \circ f$ is also in $Perm(A)$
3. If $f$ is in $Perm(A)$, $f^{-1}$ is also in $Perm(A)$
4. If $f,g,h$ are in $Perm(A)$: $(f \circ g ) \circ h = f \circ ( g \circ h)$
