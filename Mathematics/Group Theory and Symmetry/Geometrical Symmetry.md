There are three kinds of geometric symmetry:
- [Reflective Symmetry] [Geometrical Symmetry#Reflective Symmetry]*
- [Rotational Symmetry] [Geometrical Symmetry#Rotational Symmetry]
- [Translational Symmetry] [Geometrical Symmetry#Translational Symmetry]


## Reflective Symmetry

$P$ = Euclidean Plane
$l$ = Line in the plane
$X$ = Point in $P$

To reflect $X$ in $l$ , draw perpendicular from $X$ to $l$ and extend to $X'$  so that $l$ bisects $XX'$ 


## Reflective Symmetry 

Given a subset $A$ of $P$, we say $A$ has reflective symmetry if there is some line $l$ such that reflection of $A$ in line $l$ coincides with $A$

## Rotational Symmetry

We say that a subset $A$ of the plane has rotational symmetry if there is a point $O$ and an angle $\Theta$ such that the image of $A$, under  rotation around $O$ through $\Theta$, coincides with $A$

## Translational Symmetry
Given a ray $R$ in the plane $P$ and a distance $d$.

$X$ is a point in $P$
$X'$ is some unique point in $P$ such that $\overrightarrow{XX'}$  points in the same direction as $R$ and $dist(XX') = d$

Then $X'$ is the image of $X$ under translation through $d$ along $R$
