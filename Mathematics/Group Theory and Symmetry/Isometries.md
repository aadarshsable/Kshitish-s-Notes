Let $A$ be a subset of plane $P$. An isometry in $A$ is a function 
$f : A \rightarrow A$ such that: 
- $f$ is a $1 - 1$ correspondence
- $dist(x,y) = dist(f(x),f(y))$ for any $x,y$ in $A$

Any isometry of a subset of the plane is a reflection, rotation or translation.
Therefore in this context, [symmetry](<Geometrical Symmetry>) and isometry are the same

## Properties of Isometries

1. Let $f,g$ be isometries of $A$. So, $f,g$  are $1 -1$ correspondence. So $g\circ f$ is a $1-1$ correspondence. If $x,y$ are in $A$:
	$dist(x,y)  = dist(f(x),f(y)) =  dist(g(f(x)),g(f(y)))$
	So, $g \circ f$ is an isometry.
2. If $f$ is an isometry, $f$ is a $1-1$ correspondence $\implies$ $f^{-1}$ exists and is also a $1-1$ correspondence.	$dist(f^{-1}(x),f^{-1}(y) = dist(f(f^{-1}(x)),f(f^{-1}(y))) = dist(f(x),f(y))$So, $f^{-1}$ is an isometry
3. Suppose $f,g,h$ are isometries of $A$.
	Then $f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h$ . This is because for any $x$ in $A$, $f \circ (g \circ h) (x)$ and $((f \circ g) \circ h)(x)$ are both equal to $f(g(h(x)))$.
